# Aston Beamforming Workshop

In the [workshop](https://osf.io/tga2w/) we discussed how to improve beamforming methods for clinical applications and research for Elekta users. In this repository we are sharing analysis code that relates to this.

The organization is (more or less) like this
```
./fieldtrip-nai -> Amit and Jukka
./Elekta_Beamformer -> Amit and Jukka
./fieldtrip -> Robert and Vladimir
./MNE -> Alex
```
